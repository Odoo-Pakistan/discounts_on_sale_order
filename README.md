# Discounts on Sale Order #

## Allows you to define global or line discounts to sale orders by percentage or fixed amount.  ##

This code is inspired by Sale Global Discount by ADHOC SA  (http://www.adhoc.com.ar)
Instead of using a wizard, it saves in the order model discount type (fixed or percent) and value
